# MicrosoftFutureReadyTalent_FinalProject
Breast Cancer Prediction  Web app (deployment in Microsoft Azure Cloud).
Azure Cloud is one of the primary options for cloud-based deployment of ML models, along with others such as AWS, GCP, Alibaba etc.

## Why the use of the Azure App Service for this project?

The Azure Web App provides a host service that developers can use it to develop mobile or web app. 
Apart from this the developer can use to build API apps or Logic apps, which provides integration with SaaS. 
It replaces several separate Azure services, which includes Azure Website, Azure Mobile services and Azure BizTalk services gives you a single product called Azure App services.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The problem is to predict breast cancer in early stages. 
The goal is to increase the proportion of breast cancers identified at an early stage, allowing for more effective treatment to be used and reducing the risks of death from breast cancer. 

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Since early detection of cancer is key to effective treatment of breast cancer we use various machine learning algorithms to predict if a tumor is benign or malignant, based on the features provided by the data. Breast Cancer is one of the leading cancer developed in many countries  including India.  
Though the endurance rate  is  high  â€“  with  early  diagnosis  97%  women  can survive for more than 5 years. 
Statistically, the death toll due to this  disease has increased drastically in last few decades. The main issue pertaining to  its cure  is early recognition. 
Hence, apart from medicinal solutions some Data Science solution needs to be integrated for resolving the death causing issue. This analysis aims to observe which features are  most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer and to see general trends that may aid us in model selection and hyper parameter selection. 
The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant. To achieve this I have used machine learning classification methods to fit a function that can predict the discrete class of new input.
